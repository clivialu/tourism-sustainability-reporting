## In plain language

This study looks at how tourism and hospitality companies report on their sustainability efforts and how accountable these industries truly are.  
By reviewing sustainability and corporate responsibility reports, we analyze the extent, quality, and consistency of disclosures across organizations.  
The study highlights significant variation in reporting practices — while many firms show growing interest in sustainability, standardized and transparent reporting frameworks are still underdeveloped.  
The findings offer insights for policymakers, industry associations, and firms aiming to improve sustainability accountability in tourism.
